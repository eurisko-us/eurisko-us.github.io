I run Eurisko together with Jason Roberts. I teach all the classes, create the curriculum / problem sets, and maintain the Eurisko website. I also work extensively with Math Academy, developing algorithms and content for the online system.

<font size="3em">Before working on Eurisko / Math Academy, I
<ul>
<li>spent several years building machine learning models as a data scientist at a consulting company called Aunalytics,</li>
<li>modified a deep neural network to more closely emulate a brain during an internship at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and</li>
<li>worked on two particle physics research projects that involved improving data transmission in CERN and Fermilab particle detectors.</li>
</ul>

I also have a personal site at <a class="body" target="_blank" href="http://www.justinmath.com/">justinmath.com</a> if you'd like to know more about me. But the basic idea is -- if you want to learn how to apply advanced math and computer science, then I'm your guy!

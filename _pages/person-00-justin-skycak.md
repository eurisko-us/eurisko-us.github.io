I run Eurisko together with Jason Roberts. I teach all the classes, create the curriculum / problem sets, and maintain the Eurisko website. I also work extensively with Math Academy, developing algorithms and content for the online system. If you'd like to know more about me, check out my personal site at <a class="body" target="_blank" href="http://www.justinmath.com/">justinmath.com</a>. The basic idea is -- if you want to learn how to apply advanced math and computer science, then I'm your guy!

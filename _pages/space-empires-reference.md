<i>The full rulebook is available online <a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://www.gmtgames.com/living_rules/SE-LivingRules-Sept2011.pdf">here</a>. It is incredibly long and complex, so I've come up with a high-level summary below. (If the link to the rulebook breaks, then you should be able to find another copy by googling "Space Empires rulebook.")</i>

<br>
<hr>
<br>

There are 2 players on a 7-by-7 grid. Each player starts on their home Planet with 1 Colony and 4 Shipyards on that Planet, as well as a fleet of 3 Scouts and 3 Colonyships. The players also have 0 Construction Points (CPs) to begin with.

<br><br>
Scouts and Colonyships each have several attributes: CP cost (i.e. the number of CPs needed to build the ship), hull size, attack class, attack strength, defense strength, attack technology level, defense technology level, health level. Regardless of the number needed to hit, a roll of 1 will always score a hit.

<br><br>
On each turn, there 3 phases: economic, movement, and combat.

<br><br>
<b>Economic phase</b>

<br><br>
During the economic phase, each player gets 20 Construction Points (CPs) from the Colony on their home Planet, as well as 5 CPs from any other colonies ("other colonies" will be defined in a later rule). However, each player must pay a maintenance cost (in CPs) for each ship. The maintenance cost of a ship is equal to the hull size of the ship, and if a player is unable to pay a maintenance cost, it must remove the ship.

<br><br>
A player can also build ships with any CPs it has remaining, but the ships must be built at a planet with one or more Shipyards, and the sum of the hull sizes of the ships built at a planet cannot exceed the number of Shipyards at that planet.

<br><br>
<b>Movement phase</b>

<br><br>
The movement phase consists of 3 rounds of movement. During each round of movement, each player can move each ship by one square in any direction. If a Colonyship lands on a planet, then it can "colonize" the planet by turning into a Colony.
Combat phase

<br><br>
<b>Combat phase</b>

<br><br>
During the combat phase, a combat occurs at each square containing ships from both players. Each combat proceeds in rounds until only one player's ships remain at that spot.

<br><br>
Each round of combat starts with "ship screening", in which a player with more ships is given the opportunity to remove its ships from the combat round (but the number of ships that are left in combat must be at least the number of ships that the opponent has in that square).

<br><br>
Then, a "combat order" is constructed, in which ships are sorted by their attack class. The first ship in the combat order can attack any other ship. A 10-sided die is rolled, and if the attacker's (attack strength + attack technology) minus the defender's (defense strength + defense technology) is less than or equal to the die roll, then a hit is scored. Once a ship sustains a number of hits equal to its hull size, it is destroyed.

<br><br>
The above procedure is repeated for each ship in the combat order. Then, if there are still ships from both teams left over, another round of combat begins. Combat continues until only one team's ships occupy the square.

<br>
<hr>
<br>

There are a couple additional rules:

<ul>
<li>In order to build a ship, not only must you have enough CPs and shipyards, but you must also have the necessary shipsize technology.</li>
<li>The combat order is constructed according to ships' tactics level: ships with tactics 0 are destroyed immediately, and ships with higher tactics fire first. If two ships have the same tactics, then the defending ship fires first (the defending ship is the ship that was the first to occupy the grid space).</li>
<li>Previously, I said that the maintenance cost is equal to the hullsize. This is usually true, but there are some special types of ships (Decoy, Colonyship, Base) that don't have a maintenance cost.</li>
</ul>

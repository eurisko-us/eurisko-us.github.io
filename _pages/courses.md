    <summary>Computation & Modeling</summary>
    Computation & Modeling is a comprehensive, college-level course that integrates data structures & algorithms, modeling, and object-oriented programming. This is an elective course associated with a radically-accelerated math sequence intended for highly-gifted math students. It covers methods of storing and manipulating data so as to achieve a desired result, techniques used to interpolate and extrapolate quantitative data, and software engineering practices used for building complex systems consisting of many interacting parts. This is a year-long course for high school students that introduces techniques from data structures & algorithms (recursion, big-O notation, lists & sorting, trees & traversals, graphs & searching, dynamic programming); modeling (linear regression, least-squares projection, nonlinear regression, gradient descent, probability distributions, Monte Carlo simulation, Bayesian inference, coupled differential equations); and object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, libraries, testing).

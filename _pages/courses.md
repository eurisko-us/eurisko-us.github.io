<br><b>Computation & Modeling</b>
<br><font size="3em"><i>Prerequisites: AP Calculus AB/BC, Introduction to Programming, concurrent enrollment in Multivariable Calculus & Linear Algebra</i></font>
<p><font size="3em">
    Computation & Modeling is a comprehensive, college-level course that integrates data structures & algorithms, modeling & optimization, machine learning, and object-oriented programming. This is an elective course associated with a highly accelerated math sequence intended for gifted math students. It covers methods of storing and manipulating data so as to achieve a desired result, techniques used to interpolate and extrapolate quantitative data, and software engineering practices used for building complex systems consisting of many interacting parts. This is a year-long course for high school students that introduces techniques from data structures & algorithms (including recursion, time complexity, lists & sorting, matrices & dataframes, graphs & traversals); modeling & optimization (linear regression, logistic regression, least-squares projection, nonlinear regression, gradient descent, k-nearest neighbors, k-means clustering, simulation of coupled differential equations, game trees); machine learning and object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, libraries, testing). The content for this course has been developed entirely from scratch. Note that probabilistic modeling techniques (e.g. Bayesian inference) are already covered as a part of the Math Academy sequence.

    Machine Learning is a comprehensive, college-level course that integrates predictive modeling, clustering & dimensionality reduction, and reinforcement learning. This is an elective course associated with a highly accelerated math sequence intended for gifted math students. It covers methods of building models to draw insights and make predictions based on data, implementing a massively multiplayer game, and developing self-improving game-playing agents. This is a year-long course for high school students that introduces techniques from predictive modeling (decision trees, random forests, neural networks); clustering & dimensionality reduction (DBSCAN, t-SNE, PCA/ICA, expectation maximization, hierarchical clustering); and reinforcement learning (Markov decision processes, policy iteration, value iteration, temporal difference learning, SARSA, q-learning). The content for this course draws on the canonical textbooks: <a class="body" target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html">Machine Learning (Mitchell)</a>, <a class="body" target="_blank" href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html">Reinforcement Learning (Sutton & Barto)</a>

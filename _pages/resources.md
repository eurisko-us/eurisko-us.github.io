## [<center>Submitting Assignments</center>](#submitting-assignments)

<div style="width:100%; max-width:800px; margin:auto"> 

<br>Assignments will be submitted on Canvas. You will just need to paste links to your  repl.it files, e.g.
  <font size="3em"><code>https://repl.it/@jpskycak/assignment-problems/convert_numbers.py</code></font>,
  and <i>shareable</i> links to your Overleaf documents, e.g.
  <font size="3em"><code>https://www.overleaf.com/read/wjmgkxpccvpj</code></font>.

<br><br>Before you submit your assignment, make sure that your code runs, follows the <a class="body" href="https://eurisko-us.github.io/resources/#coding-commandments">coding commandments</a>, the <a class="body" href="https://eurisko-us.github.io/resources/#latex-commandments">LaTeX commandments</a>, and satisfies ALL the requirements outlined in the assignment!

<br><br>You are welcome (and encouraged) to send me their assignments on Slack to get feedback before you submit. I'm usually able to identify any obvious issues just by taking a quick glance, and it's easiest to fix those issues right away before submitting (as opposed to waiting until "later" to resubmit the assignment after it's already been graded).

## [<center>Collaboration Policy</center>](#collaboration-policy)

<div style="width:100%; max-width:800px; margin:auto"> 
  <br>In general, you are free to help each other on assignments. However, you are NOT allowed to
  <ol>
    <li>share your full solutions with others, or</li>
    <li>copy (i.e. plagiarize) others' code. (If you copy code and then change the variable names, it still counts as plagiarism.)</li>
  </ol>
  
  <br><b>Penalty:</b> Violation of this collaboration policy will result in earning no credit on the assignment, with no opportunity for resubmission.
  
<br><br>Here are some examples of things you can vs cannot do:<br><br>

<center>
<table style="width:80%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><b><center><font color="green"><b>You CAN:</b></font></center></b></td>
    <td width="50%"><b><center><font color="red"><b>You CANNOT:</b></font></center></b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Post a line of your code, or describe an idea of how to approach a problem, on the #help channel</td>
   <td>Post your complete code on the #help channel</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Screenshare with another student to discuss Python and approaches to problems</td>
   <td>Show your full solution that you're going to turn in</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
  
</div>

## [<center>Grade Breakdown</center>](#grade-breakdown)

<div style="width:100%; max-width:800px; margin:auto"> 
  
<br>Your final grade will be a weighted average of the following categories:<br>
  
<font size="3em"><ul>
  <li><b>Assignments (30%).</b> Every class, you will have an assignment consisting of multiple problems from a variety of domains. Assignments will be graded for both functionality and code quality.</li>
  <li><b>Biweekly Quizzes (30%).</b> We will have quizzes every other week. They will consist of free-response problems focused on the core principles covered in the assignments.</li>
  <li><b>Library Quality (15%).</b> At the end of the course, your code libraries will be graded for code quality. So, be sure to refactor your code appropriately each time you do an assignment!</li>
  <li><b>Final (15%).</b> There will be a cumulative final exam.</li>
  <li><b>Code Review (10%).</b> Each assignment, you will review another student's code and identify 2 specific things that could be improved.</li>
</ul></font>

<br>

<b>Late Assignments Policy:</b> Currently, late assignments are marked down by 20% per day late. The late penalty is on a per-question basis, not a whole-assignment basis -- so it's always better to turn in a partially completed homework on time and turn in the remaining bit late, than to turn in everything late. Note that, starting in January, there will be a new late assignments policy: the grade on a late assignment will immediately be multiplied by 60% with no opportunity for resubmission.<br><br>

<b>Resubmissions Policy:</b> If you submitted the assignment on time, then you can resubmit an assignment with corrections, and get up to 60% of the points back that you originally missed. For example, if you got a 70% and resubmitted after fixing all the issues in your assignment, then you could get back 60% of the original 30% that you missed, leaving you with a final score of 88%.<br><br>

Note that you can only resubmit <i>once</i> -- so make sure that you fully correct the assignment before resubmitting. You have as long as you need to resubmit, so only resubmit the assignment once you're 100% sure there's nothing else you need to fix.<br><br>

<b>Corrections Policy:</b>You can also submit quiz corrections, and get up to 30% of the points back that you originally missed. For each part you missed, you need to answer the following:
<font size="3em">
  <ol>
    <li>What was your misconception in your original answer? Why is it a misconception? What did you learn?</li>
    <ul><li>DON'T just say that you didn't understand something. Explain what it was in particular that you didn't understand. If you don't do this, your corrections will not be graded.</li></ul>
    <li>What is the actual answer and why is it correct? Show all steps in your work.</li>
  </ol>
 </font>

<br>Note that you can only submit corrections <i>once</i> -- so make sure that you correct all problems and explain your misconceptions thoroughly. You have as long as you need to make your corrections, so only submit your corrections once you're 100% sure there's nothing else you need to fix.<br><br>

<b>Grades of Zero:</b> You should be checking the grade and comments on each assignment. If you turned in an assignment but received a grade of 0, that just means there's something you need to fix before I grade it. You can read the comment on your assignment in Canvas to figure out what you need to fix. Sometimes, it can be as simple as putting your code in the correct folder/file. But in order to have your grade updated, you need to fix and resubmit the assignment.

</div>

## [<center>Study Tips</center>](#study-tips)

<div style="width:100%; max-width:800px; margin:auto"> 
<br>To prepare for a quiz, all you really need to do is make sure that you are "fluent" with the relevant problems covered on homeworks. To be clear: simply writing working code is enough to score well on homeworks, but it's not enough to score well on quizzes. For quizzes, you need to make sure that you can quickly work out these problems from scratch, without any help. It's not enough to get to the point of "I think I get this, this makes sense" -- you need to get to the point of "I totally get this, this is easy".
</div>

## [<center>GitHub Commandments</center>](#github-commandments)

<div style="width:100%; max-width:800px; margin:auto"> 
  <font size="3em"><ul>
  <li><b>Frequent commits:</b> commit your code after completing each assignment. The commit frequency should be once every couple days at most. There should be no periods where you go for more than a couple days without commits (excepting e.g. thanksgiving break, winter break, spring break).</li>
  <li><b>Descriptive commit messages:</b> name your commits descriptively. Specify what you did. Don't just name it as the assignment number. For example, some good commit messages would be "fixed rref method in case of rectangular matrix" or "added operator overloading: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation". Some bad commit messages would be "Did Assignment 26" or "Fixed a lot of stuff".</li>
  </ul></font>
</div>

## [<center>LaTeX Commandments</center>](#latex-commandments)

<div style="width:100%; max-width:800px; margin:auto"> 
  
  <br>Assignments requiring written text or math should be done in LaTeX using the <a class="body" href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/wjmgkxpccvpj">Eurisko assignment template</a>.<br>
  
<font size="3em"><ul>
  <li><b>Text inside of equations:</b> use <code>$\textrm{my_variable} = 2$</code> $\textrm{my_variable} = 2,$ not <code>$my_variable = 2$</code> $my_variable = 2.$</li>
  <li><b>Parentheses around fractions:</b> use <code>$\left( \dfrac{1}{2} \right)$</code> $\left( \dfrac{1}{2} \right),$ not <code>$( \dfrac{1}{2} )$</code> $( \dfrac{1}{2} ).$ This applies to brackets, braces, absolute value signs, etc, as well.</li>
  <li><b>Exponents and subscripts:</b> use <code>$2^{10}$</code> $2^{10},$ not <code>$2^10$</code> $2^10$</li>
  <li><b>Vertical bars:</b> whenever you want to use a vertical bar <code>$|$</code> $|,$ it has to be in a math environment (e.g. between dollar signs, or in an align environment). Otherwise, if you try to use it as plain text, it will turn into a horizontal bar: <code>|</code> ———</li>
  <li><b>Align environments:</b> whenever you are manipulating an equation, use an align environment:<br>
    <pre><code>
    \begin{align*}
    3x+2 &= 5 \\
    3x &= 3 \\
    x &= 1
    \end{align*}
    </code></pre><br>
    $\begin{align*} 3x+2 &= 5 \\ 3x &= 3 \\ x &= 1. \end{align*}$<br><br>
    Likewise, whenever you are simplifying an expression through multiple steps, use an align environment:<br>
<pre><code>
\begin{align*}
\int_1^2 x \, \textrm{d}x &= \left. \dfrac{x^2}{2} \right|_1^2 \\
                          &= \dfrac{2^2}{2} - \dfrac{1^2}{2} \\
                          &= \dfrac{4}{2} - \dfrac{1}{2} \\
                          &= \dfrac{3}{2}
\end{align*}</code></pre><br>
    $\begin{align*} \int_1^2 x \, \textrm dx &= \left. \dfrac{x^2}{2} \right|_1^2 \\ &= \dfrac{2^2}{2} - \dfrac{1^2}{2} \\ &= \dfrac{4}{2} - \dfrac{1}{2} \\ &= \dfrac{3}{2} \end{align*}$</li>
  <li><b>Integral formatting:</b> use <code>$\displaystyle \int x \, \mathrm{d}x$</code> $\displaystyle \int_0^1 x \, \mathrm{d}x,$ not <code>$\int x dx$</code>$\int_0^1 x dx$</li>
  <li><b>Evaluating at bounds:</b> use <code>$\left. \dfrac{x^2}{2} \right|_{12}^{15}$</code> $\left. \dfrac{x^2}{2} \right|_{12}^{15},$ not <code>$\frac{x^2}{2} \right|_12^15$</code> $\frac{x^2}{2} |_12^15.$</li>
  <li><b>Arrows under limits:</b> use <code>$\lim\limits_{x \to 0} f(x)$</code> $\lim\limits_{x \to 0} f(x),$ not <code>$\lim_{x \to 0} f(x)$</code> $\lim_{x \to 0} f(x).$</li>
  <li><b>Expectation and variance:</b> use <code>$\mathrm{E}[X] \mathrm{Var}[X]$</code> $\mathrm{E}[X] \, \mathrm{Var}[X],$ not <code>$E[X] Var[X]$</code> $E[X] \, Var[X].$</li>
  <li><b>Conditional probability:</b> use <code>$P(\textrm{new event} \, | \, \textrm{old event})$</code> $P(\textrm{new event} \, | \, \textrm{old event}),$ not <code>$P(new event | old event)$</code> $P(new event | old event).$</li>
  <li><b>Multiplication:</b> use <code>$P(A)P(B), \, P(A) \cdot P(B), \, P(A) \times P(B)$</code> $P(A)P(B), \, P(A) \cdot P(B), \, P(A) \times P(B),$ not <code>$P(A) * P(B)$</code> $P(A) * P(B).$</li>
  <li><b>Running off the page:</b> if a line of math is running off the page, break it after a term midway and put the rest on the next line like this:<br>
    <pre><code>
    \begin{align*}
    \int (x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6) \, \textrm{d}x
         &= \int x \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^2 \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^3 \, \textrm{d}x \\
         &\quad + \int x^4 \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^5 \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^6 \, \textrm{d}x \\
         &\quad + \int x^7 \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^8 \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^9 \, \textrm{d}x
     \end{align*}
    </code></pre><br>
    $\begin{align*}
    \int (x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6) \, \textrm{d}x
         &= \int x \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^2 \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^3 \, \textrm{d}x \\
         &\quad + \int x^4 \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^5 \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^6 \, \textrm{d}x \\
         &\quad + \int x^7 \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^8 \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^9 \, \textrm{d}x,
     \end{align*}$<br>
    Don't keep it all on one line. So, don't do this:<br>
    <pre></code>
    \begin{align*}
    \int (x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6) \, \textrm{d}x = \int x \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^2 \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^3 \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^4 \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^5 \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^6 \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^7 \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^8 \, \textrm{d}x + \int x^9 \, \textrm{d}x
     \end{align*}
    </code></pre><br>
    $\begin{align*}

## [<center>Debugging</center>](#debugging)

<div style="width:100%; max-width:800px; margin:auto"> 
  
  <br>Before you ask for help on a problem, you need to make a thorough effort to debug the issue on your own. Here is how you debug:<br>
  
<font size="3em"><ol>
  <li><b>Print out everything.</b> Within the function that you're debugging, print out every manipulation that your code makes, even if you don't think it's making a mistake there. (Bugs often show up in places you don't expect.) Also, don't just print out the values of variables -- rather, you should label your printouts with text descriptions of what they represent.</li>
  <li><b>Identify the first discrepancy.</b> Manually work out what the printouts should be, and then look for the first instance when the actual printouts deviate from what you're expecting.</li>
  <li><b>If the discrepancy involves a helper function, then isolate the issue in a separate file and return to step 1.</b> If the issue is occuring when you're passing inputs into a helper function, then create a separate file where all you do is pass those inputs into the helper function. Now, you need to debug the helper function, which means you go back to step 1 (print out everything) with this helper function.</li>
  <li><b>If the discrepancy does not involve a helper function and you still can't figure out what's going wrong, then post on #help.</b> In your post, explain what you've done to debug the issue so far, including the furthest point back to which you've traced the bug. Keep your debugging print statements in your function.</li>

  <summary>My repl was originally successfully pushing code up to Github, but now it keeps failing to do so. What should I do?</summary><br>
  
  First, try refreshing the page and pushing again. If it still fails, then keep reading.<br>
  
  <br>It's been known to happen that a repl might randomly stop being able to push to Github. It's not clear why this happens, but the solution is just to move your code over to a new repl, and then replace the old repl with the new repl. Here's an efficient way to do that, without having to copy and paste all of your files:
  
  <ol>
    <li>Create a new repl with the same name as the old repl</li>

  <summary>My repl won't push code up to Github, and I've made changes to my code in a ton of different files since I last pushed up to Github. How can I start working from a new repl without losing all my changes?</summary><br>
  
  First of all, you should be pushing to Github often enough that this doesn't happen. But now that you're in this situation, let's get you out of it.
  
  <br>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Zip all your current code into a single zip file. You can do this by clicking on the three dots in the main heading of the "Files" panel and selecting "Download as zip".</li>
    <li>Manually upload your zip file to Github. You can do this by going to your Github repository, clicking "Upload a file", dragging your zip file, and committing.</li>
    <li>Create a new repl with the same name as the old repl.</li>
    <li>Connect the new repl to the existing github repository.</li>
    <li>Pull the github repository to your new repl.</li>
    <li>In your new repl, unzip your zip file by typing <code>unzip -o filename.zip</code> into the command line. (You should replace "filename" with the actual file name of your zip file.)</li>
    <li>Delete your zip file by typing <code>rm filename.zip</code> into the command line.</li>
    <li>In your new repl, push your code back up to your existing github repository.</li>
    <li>Your new repl is now fully up-to-date and connected to your github, so you can delete the old repl.</li>
  </ol>

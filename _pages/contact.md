<details><summary>What do you think about the role of the internet/software in math education?</summary><br>
    --><!--
<font size="3em">I'm skeptical about technology teaching completely new concepts to students, but I'm all for supplemental tools. To help students build intuition for functions and transformations of functions, I sometimes ask them to draw pictures of people, houses, etc on Desmos using the functions that they're learning. But even if students learn what aspects of function expressions control what aspects of their graphs, they don't always think deeply about why those aspects are related -- they might learn that adjusting the "k" value in "y=x^2+k" adjusts how high or low the function's vertex is, but they might not realize that the reason is just that we're adding or subtracting "k" from all the y-coordinates of the points. So there's still the need for the teacher/tutor, despite the cool online tool.<br><br>

<details><summary>What do you think plays into math proficiency vs math anxiety? Is it IQ, experiences that build intuitions, or parental effects?</summary><br>
    --><!--
<font size="3em">I think it ultimately comes down to whether math is tangible for a kid -- and I think tangibility comes largely from intuition-building experiences which connect math to more concrete ideas in e.g. physics or finance. Of course, this is facilitated by quality teachers and parents who ask their kids to calculate tips/change or come up with their own answer to “how long until we’re there” based on the speed of the car and the number of miles left. But there are also plenty of kids who are able to make such connections themselves without needing others to spell it out for them, presumably due to some underlying factor like IQ.<br><br>
--><!--
If math isn’t tangible for a kid, then I think it becomes like learning grammar without knowing the meaning of words. Initially, the grammar is pretty simple, and kids might be able to get by simply memorizing all the cases. But as the mathematical vocabulary expands and moves up levels of abstraction, memorizing becomes increasingly time-consuming and faulty, and the kids eventually reach a tipping point of stress where they turn to other strategies. Some kids come to teachers for help, and invest time to re-learn the “why” behind all the rules they’ve memorized. Other kids who are unable or unwilling to invest time in re-learning their math, but who are clever in other ways, sometimes find hacks to get through particular homeworks and tests (though this tends not to help them in the long run). And lastly, there are kids who just give up, shut down, and develop an aversion to all things math.<br><br>

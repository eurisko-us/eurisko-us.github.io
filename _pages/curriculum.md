<br><b>Computation & Modeling</b>
<font size="3em"><i>
<br>Prerequisites: AP Calculus AB/BC, Introduction to Programming, concurrent enrollment in Multivariable Calculus & Linear Algebra
</i></font>
<p><font size="3em">
    <i>Computation & Modeling</i> is inspired by MIT's Introduction to Computer Science and goes far beyond it. In addition to implementing canonical data structures and algorithms (sorting, searching, graph traversals), students write their own machine learning algorithms from scratch (polynomial and logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors & k-means, parameter fitting via gradient descent). Students work primarily in Python.

<br><b>Machine Learning</b>
<font size="3em"><i>
<br>Prerequisites: Computation & Modeling, Multivariable Calculus & Linear Algebra
</i></font>
<p><font size="3em">
    <i>Machine Learning</i> covers more advanced machine learning algorithms such as decision trees and neural networks, as well as the development of strategic game-playing agents using game trees. Students also work together to implement Space Empires, an extremely complex board game that pushes their large-scale project skills (object-oriented design, version control, etc) to the limit. Again, students implement algorithms from scratch before using external libraries. Students work primarily in Python and Node.js.

<br><b>Intelligent Systems</b>
<font size="3em"><i>
<br>Prerequisites: Machine Learning
</i></font>
<p><font size="3em">
    <i>Intelligent Systems</i> involves developing agents that behave intelligently in complex environments. Students reproduce academic papers leading up to Blondie24, a neuroevolution-based game-playing agent that learned to play checkers without having any access to information regarding human-expert strategies, and continue implementing Space Empires with the goal of designing artificially intelligent agents to play it. Students work primarily in Python and Node.js.

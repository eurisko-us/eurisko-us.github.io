  Eurisko is a group of high schoolers working on advanced projects in computer science. It was formed during the summer of 2020 as a collaboration between <a class="body" target="_blank" href="http://www.theappacademy.us/">App Academy</a> and <a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://mathacademy.us">Math Academy</a>.<br><br>

<b>How rigorous is the program?</b><br>

<font size="3em">
Eurisko one of the most advanced high school math/CS sequences in the country. Students write all their code from scratch before they are allowed to import from external libraries. Being in Math Academy, these students have already learned a large amount of college-level math, including multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations, so our courses are presented at a level of intensity comparable to those offered at elite technical universities.

<br><br><b>What kinds of things are the students building?</b><br>
  
<font size="3em">
The first course in the sequence, <i>Computation & Modeling</i>, is inspired by MIT's Introduction to Computer Science and goes far beyond it. In addition to implementing canonical data structures and algorithms (sorting, searching, graph traversals), students write their own machine learning algorithms from scratch (polynomial and logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors & k-means, parameter fitting via gradient descent).

<br><br>
The second course, <i>Machine Learning</i>, covers more advanced machine learning algorithms such as decision trees and neural networks, as well as the development of strategic game-playing agents using game trees. Students also work together to implement Space Empires, an extremely complex board game that pushes their large-scale project skills (object-oriented design, version control, etc) to the limit. Again, students implement algorithms from scratch before using external libraries.

<br><br>
The third course, <i>Intelligent Systems</i>, involves developing agents that behave intelligently in complex environments. Students reproduce academic papers leading up to Blondie24, a neuroevolution-based game-playing agent that learned to play checkers without having any access to information regarding human-expert strategies, and continue implementing Space Empires with the goal of designing artificially intelligent agents to play it.

<br><br><b>Where does the name "Eurisko" come from?</b><br>

<font size="3em">
  "Eurisko" is Greek for "I discover", and is the namesake of an AI system from the 1980s that won a particular game competition twice in a row, even when the rules were changed in attempt to handicap it (<a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurisko">read more here</a>). We're all about discovering and applying knowledge.

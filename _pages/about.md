  Eurisko is a group of high schoolers working on advanced projects in computer science. It was formed during the summer of 2020 as a collaboration between <a class="body" target="_blank" href="http://www.theappacademy.us/">App Academy</a> and <a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://mathacademy.us">Math Academy</a>.<br><br>

<b>How rigorous is the program?</b><br>

<font size="3em">
Eurisko one of the most advanced high school math/CS sequences in the world. Students write all their code from scratch before they are allowed to import from external libraries. Being in Math Academy, these students have already learned a large amount of college-level math, including multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations, so our Computation & Modeling and Machine Learning courses are presented at a level of intensity comparable to those offered at elite technical universities.

<br><br><b>What kinds of things are the students building?</b><br>
  
<font size="3em">In the very first semester, students write their own Matrix, DataFrame, and Graph classes in Python from scratch, and begin writing their own machine learning library. It only gets better from there! Among other things, students also implement their own games (ranging from simple games like snake to a large-scale game, Space Empires) and develop intelligent game-playing agents. Additionally, they write academic blog posts and are exposed to the basics of SQL, C++, and Haskell.</font>

<br><br><b>Where does the name "Eurisko" come from?</b><br>

<font size="3em">
  "Eurisko" is Greek for "I discover", and is the namesake of an AI system from the 1980s that won a particular game competition twice in a row, even when the rules were changed in attempt to handicap it (<a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurisko">read more here</a>). We're all about discovering and applying knowledge.

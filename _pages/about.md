  Eurisko is a group of high schoolers working on advanced projects in computer science. It was formed during the summer of 2020 as a collaboration between <a class="body" target="_blank" href="http://www.theappacademy.us/">App Academy</a> and <a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://mathacademy.us">Math Academy</a>.<br><br>

<b>How rigorous is the program?</b><br>

<font size="3em">
Eurisko one of the most advanced high school math/CS sequences in the world. Students write all their code from scratch without the use of external libraries. Being in Math Academy, these students have already learned a large amount of college-level math, including multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations, so our Computation & Modeling and Machine Learning courses are presented at a level of rigor comparable to those offered at elite technical universities.

<br><br><b>What kinds of things are the students building?</b><br>
  
<font size="3em">First, students first write their own Matrix, DataFrame, and Graph classes, and then they write their own machine learning library (including linear and logistic regressors, k-nearest neighbors and naive Bayes classifiers, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks) on top of these classes. Students also implement their own differential equations simulator, write their own SQL parser, and implement a bunch of core algorithms and data structures. To tie everything together, students write their own massively multiplayer game and develop intelligent game-playing agents. Additionally, students learn Bayesian inference, write academic blog posts, and work with several programming languages including Python, C++, and Haskell.</font>

<br><br><b>Where does the name "Eurisko" come from?</b><br>

<font size="3em">
  "Eurisko" is Greek for "I discover", and is the namesake of an AI system from the 1980s that won a particular game competition twice in a row, even when the rules were changed in attempt to handicap it (<a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurisko">read more here</a>). We're all about discovering and applying knowledge.

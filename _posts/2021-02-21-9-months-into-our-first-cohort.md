<b>IN PROGRESS</b>

It's been 9 months since our first cohort (<a class="body" href="https://eurisko-us.github.io/colby-roberts" target="_blank">Colby</a>, <a class="body" href="https://eurisko-us.github.io/riley-paddock" target="_blank">Riley</a>, <a class="body" href="https://eurisko-us.github.io/george-meza" target="_blank">George</a>, <a class="body" href="https://eurisko-us.github.io/david-gieselman" target="_blank">David</a>, and <a class="body" href="https://eurisko-us.github.io/elijah-tarr" target="_blank">Elijah</a>) started. In those 9 months, we've covered more ground than I could have possibly imagined. This post is meant to summarize what we've done so far and what our plans are for the future.

<b>Note:</b> All the relevant problem sets, quizzes/tests, and class recordings are documented in the class pages for <a class="body" href="https://eurisko-us.github.io/computation-and-modeling-2020-summer" target="_blank">Computation & Modeling (Summer 2020)</a> and <a class="body" href="https://eurisko-us.github.io/machine-learning-2020-21" target="_blank">Machine Learning (2020-21)</a>. Throughout this post I've included links to some of the more noteworthy problems that the students have completed, but any non-linked problems can also be found on those class pages. The students also have GitHub repositories which can be found on their Eurisko pages (linked in the very first sentence of this post).

Lastly, before we dive into the meat of the post, here is a bit of important background information:

<ul>
<li>These students are currently high school juniors (16-17 years old).</li>
<li>Whenever I say "implemented" or "built", I mean from scratch. The students aren't allowed to use external libraries. They have to build everything themselves. We've been working primarily in Python (though recently, we've also introduced C++ and Haskell).</li>
<li>The students are all mathematically advanced and have learned through linear algebra and multivariable calculus. Most are in Math Academy, which means that by 11th grade, they've learned differential equations, discrete math, and abstract algebra as well.</li>
<li>Most of the students had very little programming experience prior to Eurisko. Something as simple as checking if a string was a palindrome was not trivial to them. They didn't know how to write classes and helper functions, how to work with dictionaries, or even how to systematically debug their code.</li>
</ul>
